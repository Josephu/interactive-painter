Interactive Painter
-------------------

A html5 canvas whiteboard to upload image, modify, and download the completed artwork back to your computer.

Interactive mode supports multiple user sharing the same whiteboard, using Server Sent Event in html5.

Tested on Chrome, Firefox, Safari and support desktop and mobile devices. Note that IE is not supported. [Click to see example site](http://interactive-painter.herokuapp.com)

### Use Database

MongoDB is used as backend. To setup one, you can do:

```
  mkdir -p db/data
  mongod --dbpath db/data
```

### Note

A good thanks to [HTML5hacks](http://html5hacks.com/blog/2013/04/21/push-notifications-to-the-browser-with-server-sent-events/), providing simple yet complete example for SSE.

The tricky part is the synchronization issue for managing connection and data. Connection has to be fix by having atomic operation using mutex, while data has to be fixed by merging diff data.

### Browser support
